# Fixed values such as numbers, letters and strings are called constants because there values does not change.
# String constants use single quotes(') or double quotes("")
# You cannot use reserved words as variable names/identifiers

# A variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later 
# retrive the data using the variable "name"

# You can start variable names with letters or underscores, although we avoid underscores because 
# Python tends to use underscores for its own internal purposes.

# Variable names are case sensitive.
# An assignment statement consists of an expression on the right-hand side and a variable to store the result
# Operator Precedence: parentheses>power>(mul/div/rem)>(add/sub)>ltr
# type() func tells the data type of a variable
# when you put an integer and floating point in an expression, the integer is implicitly converted to a float
# integer division produces a floating point result

# You can use int(),float() and str() to convert between strings and integers, 
# you will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters

# we can instruct python to pause and read data from the user using the input() function, 
# the input function returns a string

# you surround a dangerous section of code with try and except
# A function is some stored code that takes some input and produces an output

# max() and min() function is used to compute the maximum and minimum of the values passed in its 
# argument and lexicographically largest and smallest value if strings are passed as arguments.

# we create a new function using the def keyword this defines the function but does not execute it
# a parameter is a variable which we use in the function definition

# None is just a value that commonly is used to signify 'empty', or 'no value here'.

# the return stm ends the function execution and send back the result of the function
# Loops have iteration variables that change each time you go through a loop.

# The break stm ends the current loop and jumps to the stm immediately following the loop
# The continue stm end the current iteration and starts the next iteration

# Definite loops (for loop) have explicit iteration variables that change each time through a loop. 
# The block of code is executed once for each value in the sequence

# The == operator compares the values of both the operands and checks for value equality. 
# Whereas is operator checks whether both the operands refer to the same object or not.
